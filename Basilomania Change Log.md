## General
### Removed Global Warming - Not because I don't believe. But it's just annoying and instead of melting the ice or turning the tundra into grassland, it turns random tiles into desert.

## Changed Leader Traits
###  Alex (Fin/Cha) : Hannibal (Fin/Agg) : Shaka (Cha/Agg) : Ragnar (Exp/Agg): Boudica (Agg/Phi) - Reason for diversity of leaders (e.g. both Greek leaders were Philosophical)
